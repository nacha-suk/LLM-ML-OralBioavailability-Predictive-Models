        "The task to clone the GitHub repository \"https://github.com/Abdelmjid-Elouali/Bioavailability-Models.git\" was **unsuccessful**. The repository could not be cloned due to an external network connectivity issue preventing access to GitHub from the Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   The initial attempt to clone the repository using `os.system(\"!git clone ...\")` failed, indicating an inability to create the repository directory.\n",
        "*   Subsequent cloning attempts, including using the `!git clone` magic command, consistently resulted in a `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address` error.\n",
        "*   Diagnostic `ping github.com` confirmed a network connectivity issue, explicitly stating: \"Warning: Unable to reach github.com. This might be a network issue preventing git clone.\"\n",
        "*   The `src` folder could not be made accessible because the repository cloning itself failed due to network problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The core issue preventing the repository clone is an external network connectivity problem within the Colab environment, making further attempts to clone futile until the network issue is resolved.\n",
        "*   To proceed with the subsequent operations, the Colab environment's ability to connect to external resources, specifically GitHub, must be restored.\n"
